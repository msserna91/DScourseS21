\section{Part 1}
The data that I use was from a wikipedia article ranking what soccer national teams have been ranked the best the most times.
It is important to me because I am a huge soccer fan, and have often wondered about what trends there exist in the soccer world that leads to champions. 
Specifically, why certain teams do not win. The only I am not yet sure how useful this will be to me in the future, but I hope it can be. I used your notes to be able to scrape the data.



\section{Part 2}
For the second portion. I use information from Quandl. I updated the Renviron with my Quandl API key, although technically I may be able to get the information without it. I then installed the Quand1 library. It had good functions to pull the information that I wanted. Something that interest me is the Big Mac index. This compares the price of a Big Mac around countries. I enjoy comparing this information because it allows me to compare the worth of a product (in this case the burger) outside of just currency comparisons. This is important since currencies do not always reflect the value of money in a country. In my script I compared Big mac prices in Mexico and India.
