\section{Part 1}
One are that has always intrigued me is international sports. Specifically, the FIFA World Cup. I would love to see the data on performances, victories, goal scored, club of origin, and country of origin. I would love to see what the data shows in regards to patterns that may lead to success. 


\section{Part 2}
\subsection{Q5 Part D}
mydf is a "tbl\_df" "tbl" "data.frame"\\
mydf\$date is a character\\
\subsection{Q6 Part 7}
df1 is a "tbl\_df" "tbl" "data.frame"\\
df is a "tbl\_spark" "tbl\_sql"   "tbl\_lazy"  "tbl"\\
\\
The columns might be different since we copied df1 into spark. Since the copying process can be slow, spark limits the data displayed by default.
